## Welcome to rbrignall's GitHub Page

There's not much to see here. You might be looking for my [academic website](http://users.mct.open.ac.uk/rb8599/).


### Still here?

Here are two github projects you might be looking for:

- [OU-SUPPS](https://github.com/rbrignall/OU-SUPPS): LaTeX class files for writing assessment material for The Open University.
- [Byrdle](https://rbrignall.github.io/byrdle/): The niche choral-themed version of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).
