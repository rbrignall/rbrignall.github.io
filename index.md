## Welcome to rbrignall's GitHub Page

Most of the time, I am an academic mathematician working at The Open University. For that part of my life, you might have ended up here looking for my [academic website](http://users.mct.open.ac.uk/rb8599/).

In my spare time, among other things, I've written a few online games. I'm especially interested in developing games or puzzles that intersect with my interests in maths (including logic) and/or music.

If you enjoy the games, please consider supporting my work:

### My games

Here are four games you can play online, for free:

- [Byrdle](https://www.byrdle.net/): The surprisingly-popular niche choral-themed word guessing game (a bit like [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)).
- [Susie](https://susie.rbrignall.org.uk): A word guessing-game where Wordle meets Countdown. Test your powers of logical deduction to find Susie's word. This project is a collaboration with composer [Ben Ponniah](https://benponniah.com/).
- [Musidoku®](https://musidoku.com/): An online version of the musical variation of the classic Sudoku number-place puzzle. This was written for [Antony Kearns](https://antonykearns.com/), author of the bestselling Musidoku® series of books.
- [Numble](https://rbrignall.github.io/numble/): A mathematically-themed version of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

### Github projects

The games above are open source. You should [check out the list of repositories](https://github.com/rbrignall/) if you want to take a look.
